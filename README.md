# Lagunitas-Homework

Hi there Matthew Wyatt! Nice to meet a fellow Matthew :)

I've provided my solution to your homework in two files: makeDict.py and flattenList.py

## makeDict.py 
This program takes one argument: the name of a file containing the text from which it will construct a dictionary.
I've provided a test file called testDict.txt you may use as follows:
```python3 makeDict.py testDict.txt```

## flattenList.py
This program showcases the recursive flatten function I wrote, creating a nested list, printing it, then printing the new flattened list.
You may test is as follows:
```python3 flattenList.py```
