Congratulations on being selected to take the next step in our Internship process! We’d like you
to do some short homework. There are two programming problems presented below. Please
write Python code to solve each of them. When you are ready to submit your answers, email a
link to the code (a link to a git repo gets you bonus points!) to matthew.wyatt@lagunitas.com.
Note that we cannot accept your solutions as email attachments. Feel free to include the
answers in one file or separate files as you see fit. These shouldn’t take more than an hour to
do, we think.
Some things to note:
• This homework is totally “open notes” - feel free to consult any resource you need to
solve the problem.
• Your answers will be judged on correctness and style.
The homework:
1. Write a function that takes some text, and returns a dictionary mapping every unique
word in the text to the number of times it appears. For example, if it were run on the first
part of the chorus of a well-known song, the output would be like this:
{'and': 1, 'run': 1, 'around': 1, 'give': 1, 'Never': 3, 'up':
1, 'gonna': 3, 'down': 1, 'let': 1, 'you': 3, 'desert': 1}
Hint: the Python collections module has something useful for you here.
2. Write a function that flattens a potentially nested list. That is, it takes a list where some of
the elements might be lists, and returns a list with only the non-list elements. E.g. if the
function were passed [[1,2],3,[[4,5],6],7] it would output [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].
Hint: this is a lot like a tree-walking problem.
